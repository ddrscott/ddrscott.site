## Premise

Analyzing yourself during activities is best done by coaches. When a coach isn't available or affordable, using a mirror or video recordings are common substitutes.

Unfortunately, the act of looking at a mirror and adjusting your position to get the correct angle interfers with the action. Using a video device to record and playback is also tiresome because it takes away time from repeating target technique.

**Instant Replay Live** is set it and forget it. It shows the user what happened just moments ago. Period. It's always on. It won't fill up your disk space. There's nothing to download and it only has 1 setting: changing the delay.

In this way, the trainee can perform their action, glance at the screen to see how the did, do the action again, glance at the screen again, and repeat until the desired outcome is performed.
