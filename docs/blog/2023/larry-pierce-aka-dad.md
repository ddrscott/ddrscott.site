## Computers Are Easy, Feelings Are Hard

Today, I received the news my Dad had passed away.

Two days ago he was hospitalized for falling.<br/>
Yesterday, I called to check up.<br/>
Today, he's gone.<br/>

My last phone call with him while he was in the hospital
he told me, "I'm fine. Just really tired from the medicine. How's Karen's parents in China?"

I told him, "they're okay and thanks for asking! Get some rest. We'll call tomorrow"

Rest he did. The first and last time he took my advice.

## Not a Tech Person

My Dad was not a tech person.
He still preferred his 10 year old [Garmin GPS](https://web.archive.org/web/20190805205649/http://garmangps.blogspot.com/) and refused to have a phone smarter than him.

When he retired 10 years ago, he got his first computer and a non-work email address so we could email him pictures from time to time.
He stayed on top of the news and current events through the TV and was just getting use to reading articles on [MSN](https://www.msn.com).
He used a landline as his primary number and had a voicemail machine.
His favorite feature of the landline was how the Caller-ID showed up on the TV before he answered it.
He always knew where the phone was located because it was attached to the wall.
Phones maybe smart, but no phone is wiser than Dad.

## Humor

My Dad loved to laugh, but couldn't tell a joke.
He had a boisterous one-of-a-kind laugh that went higher pitch during the inhale phase. (Note to self: turn his laugh into a ringtone)
He was a literal person that kept things simple.
All my jokes would go over his head. Sometimes he would look up to catch them.

## Adoption

We can't choose our parents, but my Dad chose me. I was 4 years old at the time, and after logistics, I finally came over at 5. He chose my sister, too.

Here we are around 1985.

He would take us bike riding around [Lake Opeka in Des Plaines, IL](https://web.archive.org/web/20230205141050/https://www.dpparks.org/parks-facilities/lake-park/). We would feed the ducks with stale bread. He'd encourage us to be outside by being outside with us.

# Fiscally Responsible

My Dad loved to save money. He kept the same wardrobe from his 40s and would only replace articles when they were overwarn, never to have more than could fit into small closet. I believe his only real source of new clothing were as gifts.

He would try to fix everything himself and with moderate success. Our Internet was The Readers Digest Fix-It Yourself Manual and Complete Do-It Yourself Manual.

Our Youtube was [This Old House hosted by Bob Vila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Old_House).

## Hard Worker

My Dad was a hard worker. He got early and came home late. He went back to school after realizing a B.A. in Political Science was a dead end. We worked at companies until they [closed down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._B._Dick_Company) or he [retired](https://www.packaging-by-design.com). Loyal to the end, he even came out of retirement to help train the next generation.

## Retirement

In his retirement, he preferred to stay around town, visit grand kids, make sandwiches, and catch up on TV shows, movies, and the news. A simple man with simple pleasure.

Here we are 30+ years later in Harvard, IL:

## Endless Story

This is only one side of my Dad's story and from one narrow perspective.
I'm planning on having a more historical/objective write up soon.
But in the meantime, please feel free to comment if Larry has impacted your life in anyway.

Cheers to the best Dad I ever had!
