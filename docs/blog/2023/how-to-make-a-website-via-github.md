# How to Make a Website from scratch in 7:59 seconds with Github

Wordpress? Squarespace? Wix? Not today. Those are great products for hosting articles and marketing, but you want to make an application. You want to make something the old-fashioned way. You want to know what's under the hood, and you want to make it easy for others to help you along the way.

**TL;DR** - The goal is to ~understand how~ make a website. Enter Github and Codespaces!

## Steps

### Create a Github Account
I made one for my friend: TheChickenCow.

<iframe width="560" 
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCdrckv937Y"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Start a Codespaces

Use `Codespaces` instead of `Create Respository`.

<img src="/images/2023/github/step2-codespaces-800x.png" alt="use codespaces" />

We'll eventually use Codespaces to push to the repository. Otherwise, it'll take more steps to import the repository into Codespaces. Trust us!


### Create the Content for the Website

<img src="/images/2023/github/step3-create-files-800x.png" alt="create files" />

#### docs/index.html

This is the primary content of the webpage.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
    <head>

        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
        <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">

        <link rel="canonical" href="https://thechickencow.github.com/dune-scroller">

        <title>Dune by Frank Herbert 1965</title>

        <meta property="og:title" content="Dune by Frank Herbert">
        <meta property="og:description" content="A young man's journey through political conflict on a desert planet that holds the key to the universe's most valuable substance">
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Dune-Frank_Herbert_%281965%29_First_edition.jpg">
        <meta property="og:url" content="https://thechickencow.github.com/dune-scroller">

        <script src="app.js" async></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
    </head>
    <body dir="ltr">
        <h1>
            <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Dune-Frank_Herbert_%281965%29_First_edition.jpg' alt="Book Cover"/>
        </h1>
        <div class="content"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

#### docs/app.css

This provides the styling and coloring.

```css
:root {
    /* https://paletton.com/#uid=30A0u0k4ftn0mRD1TBP7no+bil4 */
    --base-color: #EADBCB;
    --text-color: #4F5573;
    --highlight-color: #70927C;
}

body {
    background-color: var(--base-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
    padding: 0 10vw;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    border-left: 10px solid var(--highlight-color);
}

h1 {
    margin-top: 0;
}

.content {
    white-space: pre-line;
    line-height: 2;
    text-align: justify;
}

```

#### docs/app.js

This defines the behavior which fetches the book contents from a different Github page to display it on our website.
This is for demonstration purposes only. Do this at your own risk.

```javascript
const book_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ganesh-k13/shell/master/test_search/www.glozman.com/TextPages/Frank%20Herbert%20-%20Dune.txt';

fetch(book_url).then(function (response) {
    return response.text();
}).then(function (html) {
    document.querySelector('.content').innerHTML = html.replace(/\n\n/g, '<br/>');
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.warn('Something went wrong.', err);
});
```

#### README.md

```markdown
# Dune Scroller

     _____________________
    < Yep. We went there. >
     ---------------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

Read Dune by Frank Herbert via scrolling the whole freaking thing.

## Future Features

As an exercise to do at home:

- Pick up were you left off, because no one can finish this book in a single sitting.
- Auto-scroll based on momentum of initial drag scroll.
- Change font size.
