JOIN and UNION are staples in SQL. In English they're synonyms to each other, but in SQL they behave very differently. They work in different directions.

**TL;DR** - Use `JOIN` to add columns. Use `UNION` to add rows.

According to Wikipedia a `JOIN` is:

> An SQL join clause combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database. It creates a set that can be saved as a table or used as it is. A JOIN is a means for combining columns from one (self-join) or more tables by using values common to each. ANSI-standard SQL specifies five types of JOIN: INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER, FULL OUTER and CROSS. As a special case, a table (base table, view, or joined table) can JOIN to itself in a self-join.

And here's their definition for `UNION`:
> In SQL the UNION clause combines the results of two SQL queries into a single table of all matching rows. The two queries must result in the same number of columns and compatible data types in order to unite

!!! tip "Memory Tip"
    `UNION` adds rows `UNder` the results.

    `JOIN` has not tip, but it's not a `UNION`.

## Data Setup

We're going to use a 2 table database. People belong to a zip code and zip codes have a named region.

!!! success "Schema"
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE people AS
    SELECT * FROM (
    VALUES
      (1, 'Candy', '60001'),
      (2, 'Mandy', '70001'),
      (3, 'Randy', '80001'),
      (4, 'Andy',  '89991')
    ) AS t (id, name, zip_code);

    CREATE TABLE zip_codes AS
    SELECT * FROM (
    VALUES
      ('60001', 'North'),
      ('70001', 'South'),
      ('80001', 'East'),
      ('90001', 'West')
    ) AS t (code, region);
    ```

## JOIN Problems

The best time to use a `JOIN` is when we need to show a column from another table which correlates to a column from a previously declared table.

**Problem**:

The Sales Team would like a list of people's names with their regions.
Create a query with each person correlated to the zip code `region`?

!!! success "Solution"
    ```sql
    SELECT
      people.id,
      people.name,
      people.zip_code,
      zip_codes.region
    FROM people
    JOIN zip_codes ON zip_codes.code = people.zip_code;
    ```

    | id | name  | zip_code | region
    |----|-------|----------|--------
    |  1 | Candy | 60001    | North
    |  2 | Mandy | 70001    | South
    |  3 | Randy | 80001    | East

**Problem**:

List all the people who belong to an unknown zip code?

!!! success "Solution"
    ```sql
    SELECT
      people.id,
      people.name,
      people.zip_code,
      zip_codes.region
    FROM people
    LEFT JOIN zip_codes ON zip_codes.code = people.zip_code
    WHERE zip_codes.code IS NULL;
    ```
    
    id | name | zip_code | region
    -- | ---- | -------- | ------
     4 | Andy | 89991    | 

### JOIN Notes

- `INNER JOIN` and `JOIN` are interpreted identically. The later saves typing 6 characters.
- `INNER JOIN` is great for finding correlation, but bad for finding unmatched records.
- `LEFT JOIN` tells the query engine we want to return all data on the `LEFT` or earlier tables even though the correlated value doesn't exist.
- `RIGHT JOIN` is the opposite of `LEFT`. They retain rows from tables mentioned later in the query.
- Mixing `LEFT JOIN` with `RIGHT JOIN` in the same query should be avoided.
- The `WHERE` condition states we only want the uncorrelated rows, the `people` missing a `zip_codes` record.
 
## UNION Problems

The `UNION` clause allows us to conform 2 or more unrelated results into a single uniform results.

<img src="/images/2018/join_vs_union_union.jpg" alt="UNION diagram" />

**Problem**

The search department wants a list of all keywords for their search index.

Return a list of keywords from both the people and the zip code tables.

!!! success "Solution"
    ```sql
    SELECT
      name AS keyword
    FROM people
    UNION
    SELECT
      region
    FROM zip_codes;
    ```

    | keyword |
    | --------- |
    | East |
    | North |
    | South |
    | Mandy |
    | Candy |
    | Randy |
    | Andy |
    | West |

**Problem**

The search department likes the results, but wants to be able to correlate the row back to its source table and row.

!!! success "Solution"
    ```sql
    SELECT
      'people'    AS source,
      id::varchar AS key,
      name AS keyword
    FROM people
    UNION
    SELECT
      'zip_codes',
      code,
      region
    FROM zip_codes
    ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
    ```

      source   |  key  | keyword
    -----------|-------|---------
     people    | 1     | Candy
     people    | 2     | Mandy
     people    | 3     | Randy
     people    | 4     | Andy
     zip_codes | 60001 | North
     zip_codes | 70001 | South
     zip_codes | 80001 | East
     zip_codes | 90001 | West

### UNION Notes
- The `UNION` clause requires all the columns from its sub queries to be the same number and type. This is why `::varchar` casting was added.
- `UNION` defaults to only returning distinct rows between the result sets. If you want all rows regardless of duplicates try `UNION ALL`.
- `ORDER BY` with `UNION` works on the final results. When ordering is needed within a sub query use parenthesis. Ex: `UNION (SELECT ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1)`

## Bonus Problem

Return the people with invalid zip codes __without__ using `JOIN`.

Hints:

- `EXCEPT` is the inverse of a `UNION`. `EXCEPT` removes the results from the source query instead of appending them.
- `IN` can be used as a matching clause in a `WHERE` filter.

!!! success "Solution"
    ```sql
    SELECT
      people.*
    FROM people
    WHERE zip_code IN (
      SELECT
        zip_code
      FROM people
      EXCEPT
      SELECT
        code
      FROM zip_codes
    );
    ```

     id | name | zip_code
    ----|------|----------
      4 | Andy | 89991

## Closing

!!! success "Clean Up"
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE people;
    DROP TABLE zip_codes;
    ```

`JOIN` and `UNION` are an essential part of a SQL users tool belt. On a day to day basis, `JOIN` is used more often than `UNION`, so we would recommend understanding it first. `UNION` gets it power when we realize our data is more alike than originally intended. Both clauses should be withheld at dinner parties and other social events.

Happy SQL-ing!
